# Rendering Map Tiles - Design Doc

The goal is to render MVT (Mapbox Vector Tiles) starting from S57 files published by hydrographic agencies and apply a mapbox theme that results in a map display such as this example from [OpenCPN](https://opencpn.org/): ![OpenCPN S57 Rendering](./opencpn_s57_example.png)


We will start by using [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) to read the s57 file geometries and meta data. Then save to a [Sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database. 

Steps:
- calculate the optimal z-index based on the S57 published scale
- as s57 files are added to the system only the `files` table will be populated. 
- `features` and `feature_geometries` will be lazily evaluated.
    - iterate s57 features, layers and save wgs84 transformed geometry [WKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry) to database using the schema below 

Life of a tile query option 1:
- stage 1
    - `tile_cache` is queried first for MVT blob and returns early with render if it exists
- stage 2
    - `files` table is queried for ids containing tile coords
    - files are opened via gdal 
        - each layer is clipped to tile bounds
        - geometry coordinates are transformed to wgs84 if needed
        - wkt or wkb is extracted 
        - layer name and feature attributes needed for theming are extracted
        - tile meta data can point to s57 file , layer and feature index
        - tile is rendered and cached
    
Life of a tile query option 2:
- stage 1
    - `tile_cache` is queried first for MVT blob and returns early with render if it exists
- stage 2
    - `files` table is queried for ids containing tile coords
    - if all file.full_vals are true then we proceed to stage 3
    - (needs more detail) on the fly render just what you need and bg process the rest 
- stage 3
    - query feature_geometries using tile coords
    - if tile is empty search up quad tree 1 and then down up to 6 levels clipping geometries to suit
    - construct MVT in layer prioritized order from resulting geometries and cache tile render

Questions:
- Can we extract the geometries straight from the s57 files and still be performant?
    - This would allow us to skip having `features` and `feature_geometry` tables altogether.
- Do we want to use and [R*Tree enabled sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html)?

Todo:
- document s57 files added / removed from system
- document s57 mapbox theme and sources

# Glossary 
#### MVT
[Mapbox Vector Tiles Specification](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/specification/)
MVTs are encoded and indexed geometries and meta data useful for drawing maps.

#### S57 
> S-57 is the data format used for the transfer of digital hydrographic data between national hydrographic offices and for 
> â€‹its distribution to manufacturers, mariners and other data users. Within this standard, the S-57 ENC product specification 
> defines how hydrographic offices will construct an Electronic Navigational Chart. By meeting these specifications 
> hydrographic offices will ensure that all electronic charts contain all the chart information that is necessary for safe 
> navigation.
